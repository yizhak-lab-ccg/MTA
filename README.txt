MTA - Metabolic Transformation Algorithm (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms3632)

The MTA algorithm is composed of two steps:
1. Obtaining a flux description of the source metabolic state via the iMAT method
In order to obtain this input (termed v_ref), one needs to run the
function 'sampleiMAT.m', found in the directory 'First_step'. 
The input required for this function to run is documented and described in
the 'sampleiMAT' script.

2. The second step is to run MTA using 'MTA.m' found in the directory 'Second_step'
The input to this function is documented and described in the 'MTA' script.
The second step directory contains example input files as .mat files
